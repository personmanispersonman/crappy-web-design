Developing Winning Strategies
1
Learn how to survive.
At the beginning of the game everyone starts off in a bus that is flying through the air. No matter whether you’re playing by yourself or with friends, try to jump and land in a area with many weapons and special upgrades. Many beginners mistake that going to Tilted Towers is their best bet, it's not. This will increase your chances of winning.
If you're playing the solo game mode, hiding out and acquiring weapons is the best way to survive longer. You can also eliminate enemies as you go along the map. This is very helpful for an extended survival.
Pick up special juices and weapons in hidden treasure boxes within the map. This is another way to increase your character’s life and strength.
In order to pick up weapons and interact with treasure boxes on the map hold “X” on the Xbox one and hold the square icon on the PS4.
Hidden treasure boxes can be found in homes/buildings/forest land.
If playing with a group be sure you all are in one spot at the same time. The closer the group is to each other the better chances you have a survival and winning the game.

Build and tear down objects as needed. To build objects, break them down in order to acquire materials. To tear them down, press “Y” on your Xbox one controller. Then push the triangle icon on your PS4 controller to access your ax.
You can interact with pretty much everything in the game to good materials like; wood, metals and brick.
Using these materials to your advantage against enemies is a great tactic.

3
Beat the storm. The storm is a pink storm that you can see on your map by pressing the menu button on your controller on your gaming device.
The purpose of the storm is to get all the gamers into one area, because the map is so big.
The countdown at the beginning of the game is 3 min. The game will warn you will the storm is coming. You can find the clock in the top right corner of your screen.
On your map is a white line that will direct you to the area that is safe where the storm cannot get you. Just follow the white line.
If caught in the storm it will take your health, and if you’re in it long enough it could kill you.
The key is to always be ahead of the storm.

4
Use the map. The map is a great way to communicate where enemies are with your friends. With the map, you can direct the rest of your team that there’s shooting coming from “SE 147 degrees” for an example. It’s also the best way to mark the destinations you'd like to go to. Press on “RT” (right trigger) on the XBOX one and PS4.
The map also shows you the name of areas on the map. In those areas, you and your team can communicate on where to go next. "Tilted Towers" is an example.

5
Pick your battles. Some battles are just not for you. If you haven’t acquired a gun yet and you see that someone else has, it’s best for you to run for cover and try to find you a weapon. You don’t want to place in the top 100 in deaths so early in the game. If you don't survive long enough, your character will be limited from upgrades.
If you’re playing with your team and all of your teammates are eliminated, the best revenge is to survive and take cover in order to outlast the enemies.
6
Know your surroundings. The more you play the game, the better you'll get identifying your surroundings.
Knowing where to go and how to get there is an important key to survival. Doing this will be very useful. If you’re with a team, acquire hidden treasure chest and supply drops.
The more you play, the more houses and cities you will come to find that have more supplies than others.
7
Upgrade your character when it's time. In order to do this, you'll have to be in the top 10 at the end of every game. You'll also need to eliminate a good number of enemies in every game.
If you acquire enough points, go to the main menu. Then click “Ls” (left stick) on your Xbox One or PS4 system to acquire your rewards.
These upgrades come with new equipment. Some of these items include wardrobes and parachutes falling from the sky. You can also upgrade your celebrations.
To do these upgrades use “LB” and “RB” (left bumper and right bumper) to navigate through the menu. Click on either the wardrobe or your celebration dances, which you can do in the game by pressing up on the D-pad).

8
Try to win. The goal of every game is to be the last man/group standing. In order to do this you must eliminate all other enemies or groups to be victorious.

9
Try to shoot better. If you suck at shooting. This will hopefully help you if you could understand this. The best way to shoot while holding Q or holding the right mouse. Some, you must have rare, legendary and any that is a good one. Some, not common or uncommon. They may have gone too weak guns. If you want to shoot like a pro. You have to cover the wall, so they could not hurt you. Mostly, if you're in danger without having bricks, woods, and metals. You can jump by holding space. Sometimes, the player misses the shot when your jumping, but do not run away or they could shoot you the fast way.
